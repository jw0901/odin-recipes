    <h4>Steak with butter barbeque sauce.</h4>

    <p>Delicious recipe for a fast steak.  Sweet and savory sauce that will make or break your meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) boneless sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cold butter, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Steps
        <li>Place each steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (or inside a resealable freezer bag) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound each steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Remove steaks from plastic.</li>
        <li>Generously season each steak with salt and ground black pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine beef broth, barbeque sauce, hot sauce, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chilled butter to broth mixture but do not stir.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke, about 1 minute. Place each steak in the pan; sear for 45 to 60 seconds on each side. Remove steaks from skillet and set them aside to rest.</li>
        <li>Pour the broth mixture into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir occasionally until butter is melted and incorporated, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon broth and butter mixture over steak and serve.</li>
    </ol>
